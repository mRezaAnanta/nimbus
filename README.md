# ☁️ Nimbus

**Learn cloud computing by playing.**

Nimbus starts you from absolute zero, like a game. Nim, a friendly little mascot, will be right
there with you, explaining every idea in plain words and cheering you on. You will not just read
about a concept, you will try it yourself on a live stage and watch what happens.

It is bilingual (Indonesian and English), needs no sign up, and runs on your phone or your laptop.

## How it works

Every lesson opens with a few short lines from Nim, then hands you an interactive stage you
actually play with. You place a server on a spinnable globe and watch the latency change, ride a
data packet along real undersea cables, knock out a data center and see the site survive or fall,
trim a cloud bill, and more. Your progress is saved in your browser as you go.

See the full lesson roadmap in [CURRICULUM.md](./CURRICULUM.md).

## Run locally

The package manager is [bun](https://bun.sh).

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```

Then open the printed URL. Other handy scripts are `bun run check` (typecheck, kept at zero errors
and warnings), `bun run build`, and `bun run format`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. In short, branch off `main` (named like `feat/new-lesson`), keep
`bun run check` clean, write [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) such as
`feat`, `fix`, and `docs`, then open a pull request. CI checks every pull request, and releases plus
the changelog are generated automatically from those commit messages.

The content lives as plain data per chapter in `src/lib/chapters/`, with language kept separate from
content per lesson, so adding a lesson, chapter, or language never touches the engine. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide, [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for the
architecture and design rules, and [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for the release history.
