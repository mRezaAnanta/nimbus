		'REST is the most common API style. Each group of data has its own address, and you ask through a method. A fit for most ordinary apps.',
		'Start with <b>GET</b>, to read data. The frontend asks the backend for the product list, the backend sends it back, and the list shows up on screen.',
		'Then <b>POST</b>, to create new data. The frontend sends a new product to the backend, the backend stores it, and that product joins the list.',
		'Then <b>PUT</b>, to change data that already exists. The frontend sends new details for product number 2, the backend replaces it, and the price changes on screen.',
		'Last, <b>DELETE</b>, to remove data. The frontend asks the backend to delete product number 2, and that product disappears from the list.',
		'[fyi] REST is really just a set of conventions on top of plain HTTP, named by Roy Fielding in 2000. Because it is simple and runs anywhere, it became the most widely used style.'
