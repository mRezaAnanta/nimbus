		'We saw that distance creates latency. But what does your data actually travel through to reach a server in another country?',
		'Many people think it goes through satellites in the sky. In reality almost all of it, around 99%, travels through <b>fiber optic cables on the seabed</b>. The data is sent as pulses of light through glass as thin as a hair.',
		'The thin lines on this map are real undersea cables that are live right now.',
		'Each cable comes ashore at a spot called a <b>landing station</b> (those little dots). From there the data enters the land network, then reaches the data center.',
		'Now try sending data from your users in Argentina to one of the destinations, and follow its journey.'

		near: 'Arrived! The destination is close, the cable is short, so the data gets there fast.',
		far: 'It arrived. But your data just crossed half the planet through cable. That is why farther means slower.'
