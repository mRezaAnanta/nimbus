		'In the last lesson you were the one pressing Add when the servers drowned. The problem is that traffic can spike at 2 am while you are asleep. You cannot stay up all night babysitting servers.',
		'<b>Auto scaling</b> is a robot that stays up for you. It watches one number, usually <b>CPU</b>, how hard your machines are thinking. It can also watch RAM or the number of requests.',
		'You just hand it a rule. Say if CPU goes past 70 percent, add one machine. If it drops below 30 percent, remove one. New machines automatically get their share of traffic from the load balancer you met earlier.',
		'Watch it. The traffic below rises and falls on its own, just like real visitors. You can also nudge it with the plus and minus buttons, then watch who does the work.'

		'scaled-up':
			'Visitors are pouring in and CPU crossed 70 percent. The rule lit up, and machines were added on their own until the load was healthy again.',
		'scaled-down':
			'Quiet again, CPU sank below 30 percent, and the machines were sent home one by one. The cost dropped with them. You only pay for what actually runs.'
