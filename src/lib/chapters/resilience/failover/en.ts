		'Spreading across AZs is fine when one building falls. But if a whole region is hit, like when the data centers in the Middle East were struck, you need a bigger plan.',
		'The way to do it is to keep a <b>standby region</b> elsewhere. The primary region serves while the standby waits on standby. The moment the primary falls, traffic switches over to the standby. Switching to the standby is called <b>failover</b>, and it can be set up to run automatically, as you will see (sometimes it is done by hand).',
		'Think of a branch office that takes over the instant the head office closes. There is always a ready replacement.',
		'Right now there is only the primary region, no backup at all. Kill it, feel the damage, then set up its replacement.'
