		'Data you use often usually lives in a database. There are two big families, and they store data in very different ways.',
		'<b>SQL</b> arranges data into tables of rows and columns. The rules are strict, every row must follow the same columns, and tables can link to each other. That strictness is exactly what lets it guarantee transactions stay consistent.',
		'<b>NoSQL</b> stores free-form documents. One document may carry different fields than its neighbor, and the collection stretches easily across many machines when the data explodes.',
