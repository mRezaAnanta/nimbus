		'Time to store data. The cloud offers three shapes of storage, and each works differently and shines at different things.',
		'<b>Object storage</b> is like a giant bucket. Files are tossed in whole, every file gets a key to fetch it back later, and the bucket never seems to fill up.',
		'<b>Block storage</b> is a raw disk attached to a single machine, sliced into small blocks that read and write blazingly fast. <b>File storage</b> is a shared folder, one filing cabinet opened by many machines at once.',
		'Open each one below. Watch how it stores things, and learn when you would reach for it.'

		object:
			'That is object storage. Files go into the bucket whole, each one fetched by its key. Photos, videos, archives, just toss them in, the capacity is practically endless.',
		block:
			'That is block storage. A raw disk glued to one machine, read and written incredibly fast. This is where operating systems and databases keep their data.',
		file: 'That is file storage. One same folder opened by many machines at once, all seeing the same files. Made for working together.'
