		'Imagine you put a video on your server, and it goes viral. Many people watch at once. This is where bandwidth and throughput are felt.',
		'<b>Bandwidth</b> is the capacity of the road from your server to the internet, the ceiling. <b>Throughput</b> is the data actually delivered each second.',
		'Add viewers one by one until some start buffering, then upgrade the bandwidth.'

		full: 'There, too many viewers for your bandwidth. Throughput hits the ceiling, so some videos start <b>buffering</b>. Exactly what happens when a video suddenly gets popular.',
		fixed:
			'After upgrading bandwidth, the capacity rises, throughput can go higher, and every viewer is smooth again. So <b>bandwidth</b> is the ceiling, <b>throughput</b> is what actually gets used. Other terms you will hear, <b>RPS</b> (requests per second), <b>concurrency</b> (how many served at once), and <b>jitter</b> (delay that wobbles and makes video stutter).'
