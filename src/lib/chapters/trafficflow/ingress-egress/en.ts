		out: 'That is <b>egress</b>, data leaving your server. In the cloud, egress is <b>billed</b>, so the bill goes up every time the server sends to a visitor.',
		both: 'So ingress comes in (free), egress goes out (billed). The more visitors download or watch, the bigger the egress bill. This is why <b>caching</b> and a <b>CDN</b> matter later, so not everything has to leave your server.'
