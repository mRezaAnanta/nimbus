		'The calm way is a <b>pipeline</b>. You just push your change. The same steps run automatically every time. Build, test, then deploy.',
		'A pipeline has two halves. <b>CI</b> builds your change into an app and tests it. That is the build and test part. <b>CD</b> ships the ones that pass to production. That is the deploy part. So CI makes sure your change is not broken, and CD puts it live.',
		'If a test fails, the pipeline stops right there. A broken change never reaches your users. Ship a good change, then a broken one. Watch the log in the console below.'
