		'You want to see the nimbus products page. But that page lives on a nimbus computer far away, which we call the server. So your phone writes a little note asking for the page, and that note is what we carry to the server.',
		'Before it leaves, the note gets locked. The words you could read turn into scrambled code, so nobody on the same WiFi can peek, or [[sniffing|security]] as it is called. This is what the padlock on a safe site means.',
		'Now your phone reaches that server first and sets up a connection, and it keeps that connection alive the whole time you are on the page.',
		'The note is cut into a few small packets, each given a number so they can be put back in order. Each one also gets a door number for where it is headed, one door per service, and secure web uses door 443. You will try this part yourself soon.',
		'Each packet is labeled with the server address, for example 76.76.21.21, like a house address. Then it is sent toward that address, passed from one point to the next across the internet.',
		'The packet does not leap straight to the server. It is passed along nearby, from your phone to your home router, the router to the next box, one step at a time. The long journey is really lots of these little handoffs.',
		'At the very bottom, the packet is just a signal, light in a cable or waves in the air. This is the moment it really leaves your phone and shoots off to the server.',
		'The server catches it and opens all those wrappers back up in reverse, until it can read your original note. Then it sends the products page back to you the same way.',
		'So here is the pattern. Each layer just adds one wrapper and passes it down. On the way out you wrap from the top down, on the way in you unwrap from the bottom up, and that order never changes. Some steps can be quick or skipped, like no lock on a plain site, but the stack stays the same.',
		'That packet can travel two ways, the careful way or the fast way. Send it over TCP and over UDP and see the difference for yourself.'

	reactions: {
		tcp: 'TCP shook hands first, then sent each parcel and waited for every one. All four arrived in order, nothing missing. That care costs a little time.',
		udp: 'UDP just fired them all off, no handshake, no checking. Most arrived in a blink, but parcel two slipped away and nobody ever asked for it again.',
		both: 'Now you feel the trade. TCP is reliable, the right pick for pages, files, and chat where every byte must arrive. UDP is fast and loose, the right pick for calls, live video, and games where a missing scrap beats waiting.'
